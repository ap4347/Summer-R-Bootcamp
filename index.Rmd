Welcome to **_Summer R Bootcamp_**. This website contains comprehensive notes and tutorials on topics covered in the bootcamp.

&nbsp;

**Objectives**: Summer R Bootcamp aims to help current/incoming MA students gain an understanding of core concepts of R programming and improve their coding skills in order to successfully complete the MA program curriculum. 

Students will be exposed to various topics of R programming through tutorials, examples, and exercises. Those who successfully complete the summer bootcamp will be able to

* Manipulate and wrangle data with different structures
* Explore data via visualization and basic models for exploratory data analysis
* Tackle familiar statistical concepts
* Communicate results

&nbsp;

**Timeline**: July 5 â€“ August 2 (4 weeks)

&nbsp;

Below are topics covered in the Summer R Bootcamp:

**Week 1: Base R**

* Data Types
* Data Structures
* Conditional Statements (Control Structures) &amp; Loops
* Functions

**Week 2: Functional Programming and Tidyverse packages**

* Functional Programming
* Dplyr Package

**Week 3: Data Visualization, Communication, and Reporting Tools**

* Data Visualization (Base R and ggplot2 package)
* Rmarkdown Files

**Week 4: Basic Applied Statistics and Probability**
