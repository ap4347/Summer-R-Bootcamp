Normally 80% of data analysis is spent on the cleaning and preparing data. And it’s not just a first step, but it must be repeated many times over the course of analysis as new problems come to light or new data is collected. In this module we will learn how to organize data in R, an organization called **tidy data**. 


The principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organize data values within a dataset. The tidy data standard has been designed to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together. Tidy datasets provide a standardized way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning).


Most statistical datasets are data frames made up of **rows** and **columns**. A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a **variable** and an **observation**. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes. For instance, consider the following datasets (the datasets are available on Courseworks in the `Module_07_data` file):


```{r}

print(table1)

```

```{r}

print(table2)

```

```{r}

print(table3)

```

```{r}

print(table4a) # cases

```

```{r}

print(table4b) # population

```


They all show the same data organised in four different ways. Each dataset shows the same values of four variables _country_, _year_, _population_, and _cases_, but each dataset organises the values in a different way. Even though these are all representations of the same underlying data, they are not equally easy to use. One dataset, the tidy dataset, will be much easier to work with inside the tidyverse.


There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

* Each variable must have its own column
* Each observation must have its own row
* Each value must have its own cell

There are two main advantages of working with tidy data:

1. There’s a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have a consistent data structure, it’s easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.

2. There’s a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows R’s vectorised nature to shine.


### Pivoting {-}

#### pivot_longer() function {-}

Unfortunately, most data that you will encounter will be untidy. For example, consider `table4a`:


```{r}

print(table4a) # cases

```


In this dataset some of the column names are not names of variables, but _values_ of a variable. Specifically, the column names `1999` and `2000` represent values of the year variable, the values in the `1999` and `2000` columns represent values of the cases variable, and each row represents two observations, not one.


To tidy a dataset like this, we need to **pivot** the offending columns into a new pair of variables. To describe that operation we need three parameters:

* The set of columns whose names are values, not variables. In this example, those are the columns `1999` and `2000`
* The name of the variable to move the column names to. Here it is `year`
* The name of the variable to move the column values to. Here it’s `cases`

Together those parameters generate the call to `pivot_longer()` function:

```{r}

table4a %>% 
  
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")

```


Let's repeat the same procedure with `table4b`:


```{r}

table4b %>%
  
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "population")

```

Now let's put them together and create a complete dataset:

```{r}

tidy4a <- table4a %>% 
  
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")



tidy4b <- table4b %>% 
  
  pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "population")


tidy_4a_4b <- left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)

print(tidy_4a_4b)

```



#### pivot_wider() function {-}

`pivot_wider()` is the opposite of `pivot_longer()`. You use it when an observation is scattered across multiple rows. For instance, in `table2` an observation is a country in a year, but each observation is spread across two rows:

```{r}

print(table2)

```


To tidy this up, we only need two parameters:

* The column to take variable names from. Here, it’s `type`
* The column to take values from. Here it’s `count`


```{r}

table2 %>%
  
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)

```



### Separating and Uniting {-}

#### separate() Function {-}

`separate()` pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears. For example, in `table3` the `rate` column contains both `cases` and `population` variables, and we need to split it into two variables:

```{r}

print(table3)

```

`separate()` takes the name of the column to separate, and the names of the columns to separate into as well as the specific character to separate a column:

```{r}

table3 %>%
  
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")

```


`separate()` leaves the type of the column as is. However, we can ask it to try and convert to better types using `convert = TRUE`:

```{r}

table3 %>% 
  
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), convert = TRUE)

```


You can also pass a vector of integers to `sep`. `separate()` will interpret the integers as positions to split at. Positive values start at 1 on the far-left of the strings; negative value start at -1 on the far-right of the strings. Here are some examples:

```{r}

table3 %>% 
  
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 2)

```

```{r}

table3 %>% 
  
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 3)

```

```{r}

table3 %>% 
  
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = -3)

```


#### unite() Function {-}

`unite()` is the inverse of `separate()`: it combines multiple columns into a single column. We can use `unite()` to rejoin the _century_ and _year_ columns in the `table5`:

```{r}

print(table5)

```


`unite()` takes a data frame, the name of the new variable to create, and a set of columns to combine:

```{r}

table5 %>% 
  
  unite(new, century, year)

```


The default will place an underscore `_` between the values from different columns. Use `sep` argument to specify how the columns should be merged:


```{r}

table5 %>% 
  
  unite(new, century, year, sep = "")

```


### Missing Values {-}

A value can be missing in one of two possible ways:

* **Explicitly** - flagged with `NA`
* **Implicitly** - simply not present in the data

Consider the following dataset:

```{r}

stocks <- data.frame(
  
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016),
  
  qtr    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    2,    3,    4),
  
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35,   NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)
)

print(stocks)

```

There are two missing values in this dataset:

* The return for the fourth quarter of 2015 is explicitly missing, because the cell where its value should be instead contains `NA`
* The return for the first quarter of 2016 is implicitly missing, because it simply does not appear in the dataset

We can make  implicit missing values explicit. One way of doing it is using `pivot_wider()` function:

```{r}

stocks %>% 
  
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = return)

```

Or we can simply use `complete()` function. It takes a set of columns, and finds all unique combinations. It then ensures the original dataset contains all those values, filling in explicit `NA`s where necessary:

```{r}

stocks %>% 
  
  complete(year, qtr)

```

You can fill in these missing values with `fill()`. It takes a set of columns where you want missing values to be replaced by the most recent non-missing value (sometimes called last observation carried forward):

```{r}

stocks %>% 
  
  complete(year, qtr) %>%
  
  fill(return)

```


You can change the direction in which to fill in missing values. For instance, let's fill in the missing values with the value that comes right after these missing values:

```{r}

stocks %>% 
  
  complete(year, qtr) %>%
  
  fill(return, .direction = "up")

```


`replace_na()` function allows to replace missing values with specific values:


```{r}

stocks %>% 
  
  complete(year, qtr) %>%
  
  replace_na(list(return = 0))

```


Finally, you can drop missing values from your dataset:

```{r}

stocks %>% 
  
  complete(year, qtr) %>%
  
  drop_na()

```


### Let's Practice {-}

Here are some datasets to practice tidyr functions with. In addition, below you can find some examples of how these function can be utilized. Try to understand what these function are doing. The datasets are available on Courseworks (`Module_07_data` file).

    names_to = "key",
    
    values_to = "cases", 
    
    values_drop_na = TRUE)

print(who1)

```


```{r}

## just run this code

who2 <- who1 %>% 
  
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel"))

```


```{r}

who3 <- who2 %>% 
  
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")

    values_to = "rank", 
    
    values_drop_na = TRUE)

print(billboard2)

```


```{r}

billboard3 <- billboard %>% 
  
  pivot_longer(
    
    cols = starts_with("wk"), 
    
    names_to = "week",
    
    names_prefix = "wk",
    
    names_transform = as.integer,
    
    values_to = "rank", 
    
    values_drop_na = TRUE)


print(billboard3)

```


```{r}

billboard3 %>%
  
  arrange(artist, track, week)

```
